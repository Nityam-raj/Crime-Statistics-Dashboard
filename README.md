# Crime-Statistics-Dashboard
📊 Presenting: My Crime Analysis Dashboard Built Entirely in Excel Thrilled to share a fully interactive Crime Analysis Dashboard I developed using Microsoft Excel, focused on crime statistics across Texas counties and agencies from 1990 onwards.
This dashboard uncovers hidden stories in the data by diving into: 🔹 Year-wise crime trends and population impact
 🔹 Analysis of key crime types — from Homicide to Theft
 🔹 County-level comparison of total and indexed crimes
 🔹 Agency-level insights across decades
 🔹 Crime rate heatmaps & dynamic filtering tools
📊 Techniques & Tools Used:
 ✔️ PivotTables & Charts
 ✔️ Slicers & Interactive Visuals
 ✔️ KPI Cards & Conditional Formatting
 ✔️ Data Cleaning & Transformation
 ✔️ Storytelling with Data
🧠 This project emphasizes the power of Excel in real-world data analysis — showing that you don’t always need complex tools to generate meaningful insights.
Big thanks to everyone who supports this journey in turning raw data into actionable intelligence.
Curious to know what you think, and always open to feedback or collaboration! 🚀
